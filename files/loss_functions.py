# Dice Loss
class DiceLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    If the inputs are all -4 and the mask only contains background pixels (labels = 0) with N = 400x400 = 160000 pixels, let's calculate the Dice Loss using the provided implementation.

    Apply the sigmoid function to the inputs. Since sigmoid(-4) ≈ 0.018 (approximately), the predicted probabilities would be around 0.018 for all pixels after the sigmoid activation.

    Flatten the inputs and targets. In this case, the flattened inputs are close to 0.018 for all elements, and the flattened targets are all 0.

    Calculate the intersection: (inputs * targets).sum(). Since targets are all 0, the intersection will be 0.

    Calculate the Dice coefficient:
    dice = (2 * intersection + smooth) / (inputs.sum() + targets.sum() + smooth)
    ≈ (2 * 0 + 1) / (0.018 * 160000 + 0 + 1) = 1 / (0.018 * 160000 + 1)

    Return the Dice Loss: 1 - dice = 1 - (1 / (0.018 * 160000 + 1))

    In this case, the Dice Loss would be:

    1 - (1 / (0.018 * 160000 + 1)) ≈ 1 - (1 / 2881) ≈ 0.999653

    The Dice Loss is close to 1, even though the model is predicting background pixels with a high probability (around 98.2%). This is because the large number of pixels (N = 160000) magnifies the effect of the small predicted probabilities, causing the Dice Loss to be higher.

    """
    Focal Loss, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.

    Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE):
    BCE is a loss function used to measure the difference between predicted probabilities and true binary labels (0 or 1)
    for each pixel. The BCE loss is low when the predicted probability is close to the ground truth label and high
    when it's far from the ground truth label. Mathematically, the BCE loss is defined as:
        BCE = -(y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)); where y is the ground truth label (0 or 1), and p is the predicted probability.
    Intuition: BCE penalizes wrong predictions more heavily when the model is more confident in them.
    For example, if the ground truth label is 1, and the model predicts a probability of 0.9, the BCE loss will be lower than if the model predicts a probability of 0.1.

    (1 - BCE_EXP):
    Intuition: is close to 0 for easy-to-classify pixels and close to 1 for hard-to-classify pixels.
    This term helps adjust the contribution of hard and easy pixels to the overall loss,
    allowing Focal Loss to focus on the hard-to-classify pixels during training, which is particularly helpful for imbalanced datasets.

    Hyperparameters a & y:
    α (alpha): This is a parameter that helps balance the importance of foreground and background classes in the
    loss calculation. If you want to put more emphasis on the foreground class, choose an alpha value closer to 1.
    If you want to give equal importance to both classes, choose an alpha value of 0.5.

    γ (gamma): This is a parameter that controls how much the model focuses on the hard-to-classify pixels.
    Higher gamma values make the model focus more on hard-to-classify pixels,
    while lower gamma values treat all pixels more equally.

class TverskyLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    The Tversky loss takes two parameters, alpha and beta,
    which control the balance between false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN).
    When alpha = beta = 0.5, the Tversky loss becomes the Dice loss,
    and when alpha = beta = 1, it becomes the Jaccard loss.

    The Tversky loss can have a value between 0 and 1+,
    where 0 indicates a perfect match between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth,
    and 1 indicates no overlap.
    Depending on the values of alpha, beta, and smooth, the Tversky loss can also have values greater than 1,
    as there is no strict upper bound for the loss.

    The problem with Tversky loss is that it is 1 when the groundtruth is only background and the prediction is showing some foreground.
    The loss is 0, however, when the groundtruth is only background and the prediction is also only background.
    That means that the difference between predicting all true and even one false is the same as predicting all false.
